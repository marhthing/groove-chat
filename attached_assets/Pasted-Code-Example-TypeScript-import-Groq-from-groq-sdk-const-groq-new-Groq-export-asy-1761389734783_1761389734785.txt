Code Example

TypeScript

import Groq from "groq-sdk";

const groq = new Groq();

export async function main() {
  // Example 1: Error Explanation (might trigger search)
  const debugQuerySearch = "I'm getting a 'Kubernetes CrashLoopBackOff' error on my pod. What are the common causes based on recent discussions?";

  // Example 2: Code Check (might trigger code execution)
  const debugQueryExec = "Will this Python code raise an error? `import numpy as np; a = np.array([1,2]); b = np.array([3,4,5]); print(a+b)`";

  // Choose one query to run
  const selectedQuery = debugQueryExec;

  const completion = await groq.chat.completions.create({
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are a helpful coding assistant. You can explain errors, potentially searching for recent information, or check simple code snippets by executing them.",
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: selectedQuery,
      }
    ],
    // Use the compound model
    model: "groq/compound-mini",
  });

  console.log(`Query: ${selectedQuery}`);
  console.log(`Compound Response:\n${completion.choices[0]?.message?.content || ""}`);
}

main();
Chart Generation
Need to quickly create data visualizations from natural language descriptions? Compound's code execution capabilities can help generate charts without writing visualization code directly.

Solution with Compound
Describe the chart you want in natural language, and Compound will generate and execute the appropriate Python visualization code. The model automatically parses your request, generates the visualization code using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn, and returns the chart.

Why It's Great
Generate charts from simple natural language descriptions
Supports common chart types (scatter, line, bar, etc.)
Handles all visualization code generation and execution
Customize data points, labels, colors, and layouts as needed
